# CrytoPass
CryptoPass is a password generator that creates random, strong, and unique passwords. It is designed to help users create secure and unpredictable passwords that are virtually impossible to crack. It uses advanced algorithms and a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to generate the password. With a user-friendly interface, it allows users to customize the password length and complexity according to their needs.

# Features
- Generates truly random and unique passwords
- Eliminates the need for users to come up with their own passwords
- Reduces the risk of using weak and easily guessable passwords
- Password strength checker, which checks the generated password against any policy regarding the password strength, such as length and complexity, and informs the user - if the generated password is weak or not
- Integratable with password manager, which can save and encrypt the generated password for the user
